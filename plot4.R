# For each question/task you will need to make a single plot. Unless specified, 
# you can use any plotting system in R to make your plot. For each plot you 
# should construct the plot and save it to a PNG file. 
# Q4.Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related 
# sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

# To run the code for these plots, please have the following packages installed:
#   dplyr
# ggplot2
# 
# And put these files in the working directory:
#   Source_Classification_Code.rds
# summarySCC_PM25.rds
# 
# These files can be downloaded from 
# https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip
